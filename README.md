# Arise My Minions

Arise My Minions is a mod about capturing the souls of mobs, breeding them, and using them to create faithful golem servants to do your bidding. No tutorial exists yet, so REI or a similar plugin is recommended.

AMM is currently in **beta**. Don't include this mod in anything you expect to be stable, as it's likely to contain bugs. This mod is for Fabric only; no Forge port is planned.
